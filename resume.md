## Experience

### Meta, Staff Software Engineer, 2016 - 2025

#### Instagram Notifications

* Added flexible monitoring to measure and pinpoint system latency and failures. In one half, this reduced MTTD from 24 hours to 90 minutes and MTTM from 3 days to 6 hours.
* Introduced a new component-based system design which empowered faster, safer changes. Using this, moved filtering components earlier, creating a 20% capacity win for our services in six months.
* Partnered with our data science and ML teams to create a new foundational product experience dataset. This enabled reductions in erroneous badging by 18%, and improved notification targeting.

#### Signals Gateway

* Delivered a greenfield, externally deployed, kubernetes-based data processor in four months which ran for just over $100/mo and could handle 2000 TPS
* Followed up with a multitenant version for agencies which could scale horizontally and be offered for under $10/mo, just six months later.
* Performed a deep analysis of bottlenecks and updated resource allocation within k8s to deliver twice the throughput with no code changes.
* Worked closely with external customers to understand needs, resolve production issues, and build future roadmaps.

#### Facebook Marketplace

* Delivered a faster first page experience by reducing the candidate set in early stage ranking and only selecting the top 20 items initially rather than waiting for a full ranking.
* Improved user experience by developing a PID-style controller for using more candidates when we predicted we had more time to work with.
* Built a native first page experience to replace our react native one due to cold start latency issues.  This seamlessly swapped to RN once the interpreter was ready.

#### Shard Manager

* Designed the next generation architecture for separating resharding decisions from execution, allowing pluggable sharding strategies and broadening our addressable market.
* Reworked internal CLI and Web UI for interacting with the infrastructure service, reducing support requests to oncall by 30%.

### Amazon, Software Development Engineer, 2009 - 2016

* Developed a company-wide service health dashboard which automatically gathers service topology and health metrics for over 2,000 services.
* Created a company-wide repository of system changes used during outages to determine root cause, collecting information about over 80,000 changes per day.
* Built a load testing tool used by over 200 teams to quantify their service's scaling characteristics and failure modes, resulting in three years of zero downtime peak days.
* Served as a website outage call leader for four years, coordinating multiple teams' efforts during large outages.
* Mentored 10 junior engineers across the company, covering both technical and career development topics.
* Recorded one of our most-viewed training videos with more than 20,000 views, "Best Practices for Outage Resolvers".
* Regularly presented our "Builder Tools 101" course for new hires, assisting over 1,000 new developers in learning our in-house toolchain.
* Travelled to London and Hyderabad to train others in giving the "Builder Tools 101" course, accelerating the growth of developers internationally.
* Identified the need for and wrote automation for the setup of new developer workstations, saving 7 years of developer time after just six months.
